*** JavaScript Notes ***
************************

* You don't have to specify data types of a variable.
* Data types are converted automatically as needed during script execution.

* Conditional Exprssion Syntax
	(condition) ? val1 : val2;

* It's wiser to put functions in the <head> section of the document so they are read 
and loaded before they are needed.

* An object is a special kind of data. It has properties and methods.
	- properties describe objects.
	- methods or functions show what the object does.
	

* Built-in Objects:
	* String Object
		** Declaring a string object: There are two ways you can declare string objects.

			var string-name = "value";
			var string-name= new String("enter text");

		** Built-in string object methods.
			*** string-name.length
			- returns the number of characters in a string.
			
			*** string-name.lcharAt(index)
			- returns the character at the specific index.

			*** string-name.lcharCodeAt(index)
			- returns the unicode of the character in place of character. 

			*** string-name.lindexOf(substring)
			- returns the position at which the character or string begins. -1 return value means the
			character or string is not in the string.

			*** string-name.llastIndexOf(substring)
			- returns the position at which the last occurence of your character or string is. -1 return value means the
			character or string is not in the string.
			
			*** string-name.lsubstr(startIndex, subLength)
			- returns a sub string from 'startIndex' with the length 'subLength'. (needs more clarification)

			*** string-name.lsubstring(startIndex, y)
			- returns a substring starting from index 'startIndex' (inclusive) ending at the index y (not inclusive).
			
			*** string-name.ltoLowerCase()
			- converts a string to lowercase.
			
			*** string-name.ltoUpperCase()
			- converts a string to uppercase.
			
	** Array Object
		** Defining an array object:
			var array_name = new Array(10);
		
		** Initializing an array: There are two ways you can initialize an array.
			var array_name = new Array(2);
			array_name[0]="Ahmad";
			array_name[1]="John";

			var array_name = new Array("ahmad", "John");

		** Accessing an index of an array.
			document.write(array_name[0]);
		
		** Updating an array.
			array_name[1]="ahmad";

		** Built-in array object properties.
			*** array_name.length
			- returns the number of occurrences in an array (how many items are in an array).

			*** array_name.join(seperator)
			- Return a string, which joins all 
			
		** Built-in array object methods.
			***  
					
	** Date Object
	** Math Obejct
		http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp

		** Built-in Math object properties.
			*** Math.E
			- The E property returns the Euler's number and the base of natural logarithms, approximately 2.718.

			*** Math.PI;
			- The PI property returns the ratio of a circle's area to the square of its radius, approximately 3.14159. 

			*** Math.LN2;
			- The LN2 property returns the natural logarithm of 2, approximately 0.693. 

			*** Math.LN10;
			- The LN10 property returns the natural logarithm of 10, approximately 2.302. 

			*** Math.LOG2E;
			- The LOG2E property returns the base-2 logarithm of E, approximately 1.442. 

			*** Math.LOG10E;
			- The LOG10E property returns the base-10 logarithm of E, approximately 0.434. 

			*** Math.SQRT2;
			- The SQRT2 property returns the square root of 2, approximately 1.414. 

			*** Math.SQRT1_2;
			- The SQRT1_2 property returns the square root of 1/2, approximately 0.707. 

	** Regular Expression Object.

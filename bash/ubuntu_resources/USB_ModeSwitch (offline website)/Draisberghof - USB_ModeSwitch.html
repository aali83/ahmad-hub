<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
USB_ModeSwitch is (surprise!) a mode switching tool for controlling
"flip flop" (multiple device) USB gear.
</p>
<p>
Several new USB devices (especially high-speed wireless WAN stuff, there seems to be a chipset
from Qualcomm offering that feature) have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when plugged in
for the first time they act like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there.<br>
After that (and on every consecutive plugging) this driver switches the mode
internally, the storage device vanishes (in most cases), and a new device (like
a USB modem) shows up. The WWAN gear maker Option calls that feature "ZeroCD (TM)".</p>
<p>
</p>
As you may have guessed, hardly anything of this is documented and Linux support by the
better part of the makers is non-existent.<br>
On the good side, most of the known devices do work in both modes with the available
Linux drivers like "usb-storage" or "option" (an optimized serial driver for high-speed
modems).<br>
That leaves the problem of the mode switching from storage to modem or whatever
the thing is supposed to do.

<p>
Fortunately there are things like human reason, USB sniffing programs and
"libusb". It is possible to eavesdrop the communication of the MS Windows driver,
to isolate the command or action that does the switching and to reproduce the
same thing under the rule of Linux or the BSD variants.
</p>
<p>
USB_ModeSwitch makes the last step considerably easier by taking the important parameters
from a configuration file and doing all the initialization and communication stuff.<br>
Starting from version 0.9.7 it has an optional success check which spares the
manual call of "lsusb" to note any changes after execution.<br>
From version 1.0.3 upwards there is a simple framework for integrating the
switching with udev (the device manager) to make it fully automatic.
</p>
<p>
<b>Please read the information on this page carefully before you go around posting questions!</b>
If you encounter a new device, it really helps to understand the principle of what is happening,
which in turn makes it easier find out about the switching command and to add a new config entry.
</p>
<p>
For hints about doing your own sniffing see paragraph <a href="#contrib">Contribute</a> below
</p>
<p>
<b>Embedded deployment</b>: I recently found my little tool in the source code of the fine
<a href="http://www.dovado.com/UMR.html">Dovado UMR</a> router, which the company publishes in
compliance with the GPL. So if you want the power of your Wireless Broadband across your local
network, but without the "fun" of setting up your own Linux router (as I did), consider
investing in such a machine.<br>
(And this is the closest thing to an ad that you will find on this page ...)
</p>



<h3><a name="download">Download</a></h3>

The latest release version is <b>1.1.0</b>. The tar archive contains the source and a i586 binary
(32 bit, GCC 4.3.2). I used libusb-0.1.12 but the "compat" library from libusb-1.0 is now working
smoothly too.
<p>
Changes and updates to the config database may happen more often than new releases; most of the
valuable knowledge about devices is contained in these files. So you better use the latest version
linked here if it is newer than the latest program release.
</p><ul>
  <li>Download <a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/usb-modeswitch-1.1.0.tar.bz2">usb-modeswitch-1.1.0.tar.bz2</a>, dated from 2010-01-24;
   a Debian (Xandros/Ubuntu) package should be available soon at the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/usb-modeswitch">
   Debian Repository</a>. Many architectures are supported there (like amd64 or ia64).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Load the latest <a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/usb-modeswitch-data-20100203.tar.bz2">usb-modeswitch-data</a> package
   (2010-02-03). It contains the device database and the rules file, including full paths. Use this version only
   with releases from 1.1.0 upward !
  </li>
  <li>The latest <a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/usb_modeswitch.conf">usb_modeswitch.conf</a> (2010-01-24); the default place is "/etc".<br>
   The config file is shifting it's meaning to a kind of reference as the system integration is more widely used.
   It can help with new devices when checking out known switching commands.
  </li>
  <li>Don't forget <a href="http://libusb.wiki.sourceforge.net/">libusb</a> if you don't have it.
  In your distribution, there is most likely a package named "libusb-dev" or "libusb-devel".
  Choose the legacy version (0.1.12) or the compatible package from libusb-1.0, at the time of writing it had the
  version number 0.1.13.
  </li>
</ul>



<h3><a name="install">How to install</a></h3>

If you have an earlier version installed, de-installation is recommended ("make uninstall").
Several file locations changed in 1.1.0, old ones might be orphaned if not taken care of.

<p>
<b>Important:</b> you need "tcl" for the wrapper script to work; if you enter "tclsh" and you get
a "%" prompt, you are set (to exit enter "exit"). The "tcl" package is part of all distributions
I know.
</p>
<p>
Unpack the source file (who might have thought!). In the newly created directory run as
root or superuser:</p><pre> # make install</pre>
This installs a config file folder "/etc/usb-modeswitch.d", a script, an
"udev" rules file and the binary.<br>
You are set already; if your device is known, you should be able to just plug
it and use it. If it doesn't work we'll find out why.

<p>
For manual use just run "make". Work with the command line interface or with the original
config file. To do the latter put "usb-modeswitch.conf" into "/etc" and edit it according
to your hardware. It's heavily commented and should tell you what to do.
</p>
<p>
Manual use is intended for testing and analyzing. See next paragraph.
</p>


<h3><a name="usage">How to use</a></h3>

In most cases, you should be able to use your device without any interaction.
<p>
For testing, debugging and taming new devices from the wild, you can use the binary
part of USB_ModeSwitch in manual mode.<br>
There are two ways for that: using a config file or using the command line.
</p>
<p>
Run "usb-modeswitch -h" to list the command line parameters. If any of them
except -W, -D, -I and -q are used, the default config file in /etc is NOT read.
See also the provided man page.
</p>
<p>
To work with a config file, create one yourself or use the provided file as a starter
and reference. If you put it in /etc and name it "usb_modeswitch.conf", it is found by
the program. Otherwise, give the path and file name with the -c option
</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> USB_ModeSwitch - like all programs using libusb - has to be run as
root (or with "sudo") when calling it manually. Otherwise strange error messages turn up and
things won't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
The automatic approach consists of several components working together:
</p><ul>
  <li><b>/usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch</b> - the binary program
   </li>
  <li><b>/lib/udev/usb_modeswitch</b> - a wrapper script using the binary, doing
   additional ID checking and driver loading. For this to work, the "tcl" package
   is needed on the system.
   </li>
  <li><b>/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules</b> - the udev rules starting the wrapper
   if a known device ID (vendor/product) is recognized
   </li>
  <li><b>/etc/usb_modeswitch.d</b> - a folder containing the individual setup information
   files per device, named according to the IDs and possibly further identity tokens (to
   resolve known ambiguities). If your device ID shows up in one of the file names, chances
   are your device is supported even if the model or brand does not match.
   </li>
</ul>
After switching and driver-loading, it is the responsibility of the system to discover
the new (mostly serial) device.<br>
When dealing with wireless devices, there may be issues with <b>NetworkManager</b> (or its
<b>ModemManager</b> component) which does not seem to be overly reliable when dealing with
USB modems.<br>
Good results were reported by working with <b>wvdial</b>, <b>UMTSmon</b> and several tools
providing a user interface to PPP like <b>kppp</b>; some of these programs may require a bit
of basic knowledge though.
<p>
There is also a new - unusual but intriguing - concept which shortcuts the tedious path of putting
together all components for a successful wireless broadband connection. The <b>Sakis3G</b> tool
is a self-containing script (including among others the latest USB_ModeSwitch binary). It supports
quite a number of providers already and is rapidly expanding. The beauty of it is that no installation
is necessary and only a minimum of input required. Contrary to NetworkManager, it really delivers.<br>
Check it out at Sakis' blog <a href="http://sakis.tel4u.gr/blog/sakis3g/">ToDo Forever</a>. There
is even a HowTo for setting it up so that it connects right away when a modem is plugged in.
</p>
<p>
The main hurdle for NetworkManager and others to a fully automated use of a newly switched modem
is to find the right port for connecting. Often more than one serial port is created after switching
(even up to five). Generally, the right one is providing an interrupt transfer endpoint.
Unfortunately, NetworkManager does rely on other ways of probing for the correct port and
sometimes fails. It is worth to note that the said Sakis3G tool is able to find this port quite
easily.
</p>
<p>
If you managed to get a new or badly supported device to switch correctly in manual mode, you can
add a udev rule and a config file yourself. But <b>please</b> report it back to share it !!
</p>

<h3><a name="hardware">Known working hardware</a></h3>

<b>Very important note:</b><br>
Personally, I could only test my Option Icon and the S.E. MD400; the list here - as well as all the
necessary data - relies on reports from third parties (people, that is). So don't
be surprised if you hit sudden obstacles even with your device listed here.
You have been warned.
<p>
There are hitherto three known methods for initiating the switching process:<br>
</p><ol>
<li>sending a rarely used or seemingly weird standard storage command (equivalent to those of SCSI)
to the storage device ("eject" for example)</li>
<li>actively removing (rather detaching) the storage driver from the device</li>
<li>sending a certain control message to the device</li>
</ol>

<p>
Again, <b>if you don't find the name of your device in this list, it may still be supported</b>.
The important thing is that you find your device's USB ID in the config file folder. Have
a look into the latest data package (See <a href="#download">Download</a>.).
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>All Option devices</b><br>
   All known Option devices use the USB storage command REZERO UNIT for switching (inherited from SCSI).
   Older devices change vendor and product ID, newer ones don't (just their device class). These newer
   sticks have a special interface after switching (HSO) for which there is a specific driver. Some older
   devices are able to be loaded with the new HSO firmware which changes their behaviour.<br>
   Note: for HSO driver questions and HowTos consult the fine <a href="http://www.pharscape.org/">Pharscape</a> site!<br>
   All Option devices come included in the config database of the new integrated version. There is no need
   to use "<b>ozerocdoff</b>" or "<b>rezero</b>" anymore.<br>
   There is a switching routine for Option devices in the kernel driver usb-storage (since beginning
   of 2009). It works only for devices entered in "unusual_devs.h". More to that below.<br>
   You can safely install USB_ModeSwitch alongside. If your Option device gets switched by the kernel
   it just does nothing, otherwise it kicks in.
   </li>
  <li><b>Option GlobeSurfer iCON</b> (aka "<b>Vodafone EasyBox</b>")<br>
   The thing that started it all, because I wanted it to work on my Linux router.<br>
   </li>
  <li><b>Option GlobeSurfer iCON 7.2</b><br>
   If you get hardware lockups of this thing when plugging in (flashing LEDs), update the firmware.
   You can probably update it to the new HSO interface
   </li>
  <li><b>Option GlobeTrotter HSUPA Modem</b> (aka "<b>T-Mobile wnw Card Compact III</b>")<br>
   HSO interface
   </li>
  <li><b>Option GlobeTrotter GT MAX 3.6</b> (aka "<b>T-Mobile wnw Card Compact II</b>")
   </li>
  <li><b>Option GlobeTrotter EXPRESS 7.2</b> (aka "<b>T-Mobile wnw Card Express II</b>")
   </li>
  <li><b>Option GlobeTrotter GT MAX "7.2 Ready"</b><br>
   </li>
  <li><b>Option iCON 210</b><br>
   Not sure if this is a generic Option design (see PROLiNK A600)
   </li>
  <li><b>Option iCON 225 HSDPA</b> (aka "<b>T-Mobile web'n'walk Stick</b>")<br>
   HSO interface
   </li>
  <li><b>Option iCON 401</b> and <b>AT&amp;T Quicksilver</b><br>
   HSO interface; has additional Micro SD.<br>
   The Quicksilver looks exactly like the 401 but the product ID is different.
   </li>
  <li><b>Vodafone K3760</b> (an Option device, original name yet unknown)<br>
   HSO interface
   </li>
  <li>All remaining <b>Option HSO devices</b><br>
   </li>
  <li><b>All Huawei devices</b><br>
   Some need a custom control message and others want a custom bulk message.<br>
   Newer kernels try to apply the control message to certain Huawei devices from the driver
   (special treatment in usb-storage). The latest models are not supported by the kernel.<br>
   You can safely install USB_ModeSwitch alongside. If your Huawei gets switched by the kernel
   it just does nothing, otherwise it kicks in.
   </li>

<h3><a name="trouble">Troubleshooting</a></h3>

<b>Note: if you still need support after having followed the advice on this page, please
use the forum!</b>
<p>
For debugging of the automated system integration, edit (as root or su)
<b>/lib/udev/usb_modeswitch</b> in a text editor and change the line </p><pre> set logging 0</pre>
to <pre> set logging 1</pre>This gives you a verbose output of the hotplug activity to
<b>/var/log/usb_modeswitch_&lt;device&gt;</b>.

<p>
If you're next to certain that you have the right values for your device, followed
all the hints (see <a href="#hardware">Known working hardware</a>), 
and USB_ModeSwitch seems to do something run after run but to no effect, there
are most likely system issues involved.
</p>
<p>
The first suspects are system rules for modems which handle things not quite
correctly.<br>
If you own a device with the unswitched ID of <b>05c6:1000</b>, it will most likely
get a wrong switching command. There are four different types of switching devices,
all with that same ID; in the big distributions they are all treated alike as a
model from "Option" (the manufacturer) which is wrong in three out of four cases.
There are even cell phones with that ID which get the same treatment when connected
to an USB port.
</p>
<p>
To fix problems like that you can try to remove rules files from "/lib/udev/rules.d"
which contain calls to "modem-modeswitch".<br>
USB_ModeSwitch will do additional checks beside the USB ID and treat all known 
ambiguous devices in the right way. Furthermore, it leaves unknown devices with
the <b>05c6:1000</b> ID alone.

In some newer kernels, certain device families (some Option, some Huawei, some ZTE from 2.6.26 to 2.6.28)
get a special treatment in the usb-storage code to enable switching right away. You would not need
USB_ModeSwitch anymore for these specific dvices; on the other hand you have no choice of accessing
the "CD-ROM" part of your device. Plus, there were cases when the special treatment brought
no results and furthermore prevented USB_ModeSwitch to work properly afterwards (happened with
ZTE devices, error "-2").
<p>
In case of trouble, look into "unusual_devs.h" in the "drivers/usb/storage" folder of
your kernel source. If your default ID (vendor and product ID of the storage part) can be found there and
you get errors when running USB_ModeSwitch, try first to blacklist "usb-storage".<br>
If that helps, you should consider rebuilding your kernel with the entry in "unusual_devs.h" deactivated.
The only thing that will happen is that usb-storage works in the default way afterwards.<br>
I found a <a href="http://ru.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/MF626">tip</a> in the Russian Gentoo wiki to do exactly what I just
 suggested for the <b>ZTE MF626</b>.
</p>
<p>
Annother way of influencing the kernel behaviour is the parameter "delay_use" of
"usb-storage" which sets the time in seconds after plugging when the storage device will
actually be used (and probably automounted). The default value is 5; this might affect
the switching result under certain conditions.<br>
To change the default add in /etc/modprobe.conf:
</p><pre> options usb-storage delay_use=1 (or 10, or other)</pre>
I will try and monitor - possibly influence - further kernel development to prevent unpleasant
surprises in the future.<br>
Between the kernel USB developers there is a consensus about future removal of any switching
code from the kernel if the "userspace" handling is broadly working and available.

USB_ModeSwitch comes quite handy for experimenting with your own hardware if not supported yet.
You could try this approach:
<p>
Note the device's Vendor and Product ID from /proc/bus/usb/devices (or from
the output of "lsusb"); the assigned driver is usually "usb-storage".
Then try spying out the USB communication to the device with the same ID inside M$ Windoze.<br>
I recommend this tool: "SniffUSB" (<a href="http://www.pcausa.com/Utilities/UsbSnoop/default.htm">http://www.pcausa.com/Utilities/UsbSnoop/default.htm</a>).<br>

This is the extremely short version. There is a very good case example from Mark A. Ziesemer here:<br>
